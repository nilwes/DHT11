/**
This example illustrates how to use the DHT11 sensor with Toit
Normally, the same GPIO pin would be used as output for triggering the sensor, 
and subsequently switched to input for reading the response.
However since the DHT response comes so quickly, there is no time to
switch the pin from output to input. Hence two pins are needed: One
for triggering the data, and a second for reading data.
Both should be connected to the data pin of your DTH sensor.
